# people_stress_detection
My first work from Kaggle. I decided to upload it to my github. why not :)
The essence of the project is to determine the level of stress of a person, based on such characteristics as the amount of sleep, heartbeat, and so on. In general, I worked a little with the data, made a couple of graphs. Classification was carried out using gradient boosting. In general, this is the whole project
